    "class is a detailed description, the definition, and the template of what an object will be. But it is not the object itself. We call class is the building block that leads to object-oriented programming.  It is a user-defined data type, that holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It is the blueprint of any object.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "    consider the class of Accounts. There may be many accounts with deifferent names and types, but all of them will share some common properties, as all of them will have some common attributes like balance,account holder name etc. so here, the account is the class.\n",

    "Inheritance  is the one of the pillar in Oops. It is mechanism that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that shares a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class. Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.\n",

    "    \n",
    "1.Single inheritance:\n",
    "        \n",
